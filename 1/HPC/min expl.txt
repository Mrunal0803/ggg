The code you provided performs parallel reductions to find the minimum, maximum, sum, and average of a given set of values using OpenMP.
 Let's go through the code and explain its functionality.

cpp
Copy code
template<typename T>
T parallelMin(const std::vector<T>& data) {
    T minVal = data[0];

    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(min: minVal)
    for (int i = 1; i < data.size(); ++i) {
        if (data[i] < minVal) {
            minVal = data[i];
        }
    }

    return minVal;
}
The parallelMin function takes a vector data as input and finds the minimum value in parallel using OpenMP. 
It initializes minVal with the first element of data and then uses the #pragma omp parallel for directive to parallelize the for loop. 
The reduction(min: minVal) clause ensures that each thread has its own copy of minVal and performs a reduction operation to find the minimum value
 among the partial results obtained by each thread. The minimum value is updated if a smaller value is found.

cpp
Copy code
template<typename T>
T parallelMax(const std::vector<T>& data) {
    T maxVal = data[0];

    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(max: maxVal)
    for (int i = 1; i < data.size(); ++i) {
        if (data[i] > maxVal) {
            maxVal = data[i];
        }
    }

    return maxVal;
}
The parallelMax function is similar to parallelMin but finds the maximum value. It initializes maxVal with the first element of data and uses the reduction(max: maxVal) 
clause in the #pragma omp parallel for directive to perform a reduction operation to find the maximum value among the partial results obtained by each thread.

cpp
Copy code
template<typename T>
T parallelSum(const std::vector<T>& data) {
    T sum = std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), static_cast<T>(0));

    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+: sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); ++i) {
        sum += data[i];
    }

    return sum;
}
The parallelSum function calculates the sum of the values in data using parallel reduction. 
It first uses std::accumulate to calculate the initial sum of the values. Then, it uses the #pragma omp parallel for directive
 with the reduction(+: sum) clause to parallelize the for loop and perform a reduction operation to calculate the sum of the values obtained by each thread.

cpp
Copy code
template<typename T>
double parallelAverage(const std::vector<T>& data) {
    T sum = parallelSum(data);
    return static_cast<double>(sum) / data.size();
}
The parallelAverage function uses the parallelSum function to calculate the sum of the values and then divides 
it by the size of the data vector to find the average. The result is returned as a double type.

In the main function, the code reads the number of values from the user and then reads the values into a vector. 
It calls the parallel reduction functions to find the minimum, maximum, sum, and average of the values and prints the results to the console.

Overall, the code efficiently performs parallel reductions to find statistical properties of a set of values using OpenMP.
